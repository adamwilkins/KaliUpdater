A simple bash script to install Kali configurations and get up and running faster

So far configures the following:

- wallpapers
- VSS Code
- Fixes proxychains config
- installs tilix and configures it
- sets up nuclei
- installs pipx
- installs netexec
- and configures the vmshare

with more to come.
